# XMOTO_TINYAVR

I am trying to convert a DC gear motor as a ClosedLoop stepper motor. The advantages are obvious, weight and size of the motor are much lower and we have a much higher power due to the gearbox. By reading out the Hall sensors, we are also able to measure the position accurately and, if the axis is adjusted manually, to reset it immediately to the measured position. So a servo stepper motor on smallest space to realize.
